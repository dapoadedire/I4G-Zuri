                            have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in

                            - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has

                            <li><strong>Igniting the personal computer revolution.</strong>
                                With the Apple II and the Macintosh, Jobs and the then-named Apple Computer (AAPL)
                                helped to
                                launch the PC revolution. The Apple II, released in 1977, was one of the first highly
                                successful mass-produced personal computers. The Macintosh, introduced in 1984, was the
                                first commercially successful PC to use a mouse and graphical user interface.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Creating the Apple I.</strong>
                                Jobs created the Apple I, a microprocessor-based personal computer that was the first
                                commercially successful microcomputer. The Apple I was designed to be a low-cost,
                                portable personal computer. The Apple I was designed to be a low-cost, portable personal
                                computer.

                            <li><strong>Introducing the mouse and graphical user interface.</strong>
                                Jobs changed how people interact with personal computers by replacing the text-based
                                command-line interface with a mouse-driven graphical user interface. Instead of typing
                                in
                                commands with a keyboard, users could click on on-screen icons using a mouse controller.
                                Jobs borrowed the idea for the new interface from Xerox 's (XRX) Palo Alto Research
                                Center,
                                which failed to see its potential.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Bringing portable music players to the masses.</strong>
                                Others had come out with portable digital music players before Apple debuted the iPod in
                                2001. But Apple made the device a fun, simple and fashionable way to store thousands of
                                songs. Jobs' creation soon dominated the market.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Revolutionizing the sale of music.</strong>
                                Jobs turned music distribution on its head with the iTunes store by offering consumers
                                an
                                easy and affordable way to download songs to their computers and iPods. The iTunes store
                                offered people an alternative to buying music CDs or illegally downloading songs from
                                online
                                sharing services.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Shepherding the age of computer animation.</strong>
                                Jobs ushered in the age of feature-length computer-animated movies by funding and
                                leading
                                Pixar Animation Studios. Jobs bought an unproven animation studio from George Lucas in
                                1986
                                and turned it into a maker of blockbuster films, starting with "Toy Story" in 1995. Walt
                                Disney (DIS) purchased Pixar in 2006 for $7.4 billion.

                            <li><strong>Opening Apple stores.</strong>
                                Jobs defied the skeptics when he launched a chain of Apple retail stores starting in
                                2001. The stores have proved to be a huge success, not only in selling products but also
                                extending the Apple brand and cachet worldwide. Apple now operates more than 350 stores.

                                    Making personal computers stylish.</strong>
                                From the start, Apple computers have stood out as stylish. From the candy-colored
                                original iMacs to the superthin MacBook Air, Apple has made products that consumers
                                crave. When it came to Apple's products, Jobs sweated the details of fit and finish.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Launching the smartphone revolution.</strong>
                                When Jobs got Apple into the mobile phone business with the iPhone in 2007, he didn't
                                just add cellular phone capabilities to an iPod or vice versa, as some expected. He came
                                out with a landmark device that merged an iPod, full Internet browser and mobile phone
                                into a beautiful gadget with a multitouch-screen interface. The iPhone was an instant
                                hit and begat a thousand copycats.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Changing how software applications are distributed.</strong>
                                Jobs changed how software applications are distributed when he opened the App Store for
                                downloading applications to the iPhone and iPod Touch in 2008. He gave developers a way
                                to write and sell mobile programs to consumers online. Its success created a vibrant
                                ecosystem that has boosted demand for Apple's mobile devices.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Kicking off the tablet trend.</strong>
                                Apple faced a lot of doubters when Jobs debuted the iPad tablet in April 2010. But the
                                media tablet soon became another hit product.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Introducing the iPod touch.</strong>
                                Jobs introduced the iPod touch, a portable digital music player that was the first
                                commercially successful digital music player. The iPod touch was designed to be a
                                portable music player. The iPod touch was designed to be a portable music player.
